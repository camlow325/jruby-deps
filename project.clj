  ;; NOTE: jruby-stdlib packages some unexpected things inside
  ;; of its jar.  e.g., it puts a pre-built copy of the bouncycastle
  ;; and snakeyaml jars into its META-INF directory.  This is highly
  ;; undesirable for projects that already have dependencies on different
  ;; versions of these jars.  Therefore, when building uberjars,
  ;; you should take care to exclude the things that you don't want
  ;; in your final jar.  Here is an example of how you could exclude
  ;; that from the final uberjar:
  :uberjar-exclusions  [#"META-INF/jruby.home/lib/ruby/stdlib/org/bouncycastle"
                        #"META-INF/jruby.home/lib/ruby/stdlib/org/yaml/snakeyaml"])
